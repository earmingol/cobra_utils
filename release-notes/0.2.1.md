# Release notes for cobra_utils 0.2.1

## New features
* Added verbose in *cobra_utils.io.load_model* function
* Added [jupyter notebook with example of reporter metabolites in *E. coli*](../notebooks/Ecoli_Reporter_Metabolites.ipynb)

## Fixes
* Changed format of returned dataframe from cobra_utils.query functions. First info is the origen of the query, then followed by
the element queried (e.g. rxn_from_metabolites returns first the metabolites, then reactions, followed by genes, subsystems and rxn formula)
* Changed the way of importing in the \__init__.py files. Now every function is called from that file,
instead of putting for example, ``from cobra_utils.io.load_data import *``, now they are imported ```from cobra_utils.io.load_data import load_model```

## Deprecated features
